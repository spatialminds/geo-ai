# Welcome to GeoAI

In this series, we'll be taking a look at Artificial Intelligence as it applies to Geographic data on macOS.

We've already seen applications in several areas.  Machine Learning has been applied extensively to classify sattelite imagery.  Artificial Intelligence is finding many applications in Location Intelligence.  Generative Cartography is off to a horribly innacurate start, but they sure do offer a beautiful aesthetic that's been sorely missing since we dropped manual cartography and moved over to Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

While Apple Silicon brings strong GPU performance to Apple hardware, Mojo being brought to macOS, and the iPhone has a dedicated AI chip, the Apple Developer situation isn't as good.  Swift simply doesn't have a lot of traction in the AI / Data Analytics space.  Similarly, natively working geospatial data in Swift has been sorely missing.  With AI, ML, Statistics, and Geographic Information Systems having a long development history on Unix, C/C++ developers fair better by having all of the libraries available to them. There is a strong need in the Swift Community to bring these C/C++ libraries into our ecosystem.  For now, on macOS, most need to rely on Python and R.  We'll take a look at Python on macOS and Apple Silicon as well as how we can bridge across to Python libraries from Swift.
